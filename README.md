# Solidity-lite
Many thanks to Juanfranblanco for the vscode extension https://github.com/juanfranblanco/vscode-solidity.

This is the lite version of the solidity extension, created mainly for personal use.
It removed the following unnecessary functionalities.
- It cleared the context menu. The orginal solidity extension has taken too much in the context menu.
- It removed the contract compilation function. We all have tools like `truffle` or `hardhat` for compiling contracts. No need to keep this part. 
- It removed the code generation.
